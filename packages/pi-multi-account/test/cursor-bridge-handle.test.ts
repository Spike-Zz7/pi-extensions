/**
 * Pi died with ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END on 2026-08-23, minutes after compaction started
 * closing the Cursor conversation:
 *
 *   at Object.write (cursor/proxy.ts:378)          <- the bridge handle
 *   at sendKvResponse (cursor/proxy.ts:1218)       <- answering Cursor's blob request
 *   at processServerMessage (cursor/proxy.ts:1191) <- data still arriving on a closed bridge
 *
 * The write site was already wrapped in try/catch, and that is the whole trap: a write into an
 * ended pipe does not throw there. Node raises it on a later tick as an `error` event on the
 * stream, and a stream with no error listener turns that into an uncaughtException — fatal for
 * the host, from inside a provider bridge that has no business ever killing it.
 *
 * These tests lock the class, not just the one path: nothing the bridge does may reach the
 * host as an uncaught exception, and a pipe we closed ourselves must read as closed.
