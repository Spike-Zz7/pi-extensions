 * big is the conversation Cursor is holding on its side. The two agree until Pi compacts — after
 * that Pi's request is small while Cursor's number stays at the old size, and Pi reads its own
 * context as being over the window on every single turn.
 *
 * Real numbers from a session, one reply after a completed compaction:
 * request ≈ 53 000 tokens, Cursor answered 208 632, Pi compacted again three minutes later and
 * lost its summary doing it.
 *
 * So the measured request wins, and Cursor's counter is only a fallback for when we could not
 * measure anything at all.
